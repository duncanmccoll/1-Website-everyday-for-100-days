# Day 4

Day 4 is located in a seperate repo: [RoR_Blog](https://github.com/duncanmccoll/RoR_blog)

Today I tried to make a Ruby on Rails application running on a Heroku Web Server. I'm still trying to figure out the in and outs of Ruby on Rails. I'll ask around the community and try get it up and running. 

Just one of the many roadblocks on my Ruby on Rails journey.
